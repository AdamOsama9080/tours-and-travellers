Our spectacular guide, one of the best made us feel part of his family, very respectful and wise, answered any doubt or question we had, really a great help at all times. I highly recommend this tour and especially our guide Phoebe, We had a 22 hour layover in Cairo and wanted to do a tour of the top sites. Zenab was our guide and she was absolutely fantastic! Went hit the sites we wanted to and she had great knowledge of everything! Would definitely recommend",
